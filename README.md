## Context:

A leading ecommerce platform is always looking for ways to generate revenue, one of them is by making customers repeat purchases. Many customers use ecommerce platform due to discounts and ease, but many among them stopped purchasing through the app at certain point. Company would like to identify signals of churning customers to prevent them from stopping. Signals are collected from customers behaviour and their characteristics.
To identify churning customers, company hired a team of data scientist to investigate further.

The data scientist team collaborates with Business Development, Customer Satisfaction and Growth Team to analyze the task.


#### Target:

0 = Not churn

1 = Churn

 

## Problem Statement:

Churn rates are important because losing customers means losing revenue. This is critical because maintaining loyal customers base will be much easier to generate profit, as acquiring new customers is more expensive than to maintain existing client.
